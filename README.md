# A simple SSH Certificate Authority

Current state: **Proof of concept**.

A small SSH server that generates SSH user certificates on demand over
an SSH connection.

You connect to the CA with your ordinary SSH client, using public key
authentication.

Use it like this to first generate a certificate and then use the
certificate to login to a server:

```
$ ssh -p 2222 user@localhost > cert.pub
$ ssh -i cert.pub user@some-ssh-server
```

The generated certificate will be valid and limited to the user name
you use here ("user" above). Any user name is currently accepted if
your public key is in the list of authorized keys.

You can use a TKey both for the user authentication and for the CA.
The connection with the the TKey happens transparently through the use
of [tkey-ssh-agent](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-ssh-agent/)
running both on the CA server and your machine.

*Nota bene*: The TKey is (so far) *not required* to use this program.

## Rationale

- System owners don't want to manage individual users' public keys on
  the servers or embedded systems.

- Instead, they only install a trusted CA public key on all servers.

- The system owner hands out Tillitis TKeys to all trusted users and
  enrolls them with the `tkey-ssh-ca`.

- Short-lived certificates are automatically generated when needed and
  specific to certain user roles or hosts, authenticated by the user's
  long-lived TKey identity.

## Setup

You need to generate a host key pair to identify the host running the
ssh-ca:

$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519

Call it `host_ed25519`.

You need the
[tkey-ssh-agent](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-ssh-agent/)
installed and running on both the CA server and the user's machine.

Make sure the `ssh-keygen` command is available.

If you don't want to touch the TKey every time the CA generates a cert
look into the documentation to compile the tkey-ssh-agent and the
corresponding
[tkey-device-signer](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-device-signer)
without the touch requirement.

After starting the tkey-ssh-agent (possibly with a USS), get the
public key of your CA's key pair, typically with `ssh-add -L`. Place
the key in a file called `ca_key.pub` in the ssh-ca directory.

Note that if you're trying this out on the same machine you can use
the same pubkey both for the CA and the user. You will then be
expected to touch your TKey twice: first when authentication to
tkey-ssh-ca, then to sign the new cert.

If you want to, you can allow anyone to request a certificate. If you
want to allow this, start the `tkey-ssh-ca` with the `--insecure`
flag. NOTE WELL: Anyone who requests a certificate and presents a
public key will get a certificate!

If, on the other hand, you want to allow just a list of approved
identities to request a cert: Get the users' public keys and place
them in `authorized_keys` in the tkey-ssh-ca directory, one per line
in this format:

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAA... key-id@domain
```

Insert the TKey in the CA server.

Start the CA server:

```
$ ./tkey-ssh-ca
```

## On the servers

Place the CA's public key you extracted to `ca_key.pub` in `/etc/ssh`
on the servers you want to access.

Add this line:


```
TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca_key.pub
```

to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

Restart sshd.

Your server now trusts user certificates generated by this CA. You
should be able to login with a cert.

## Development

tkey-ssh-ca currently depends the tkey-ssh-agent running on the CA
server, too. This might change. It might, instead, connect to the TKey
directly.
